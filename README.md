# Super Sessions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## A Personal Note

While working on **Super Sessions**, my heart just melted seeing these kids doing activities for fun. It truly reminded me of the simple days. This project became a nostalgic and enjoyable experience for me.

To the hiring team: If I don't get accepted for the position of **UI/UX and Web Designer**, it is completely fine. You are welcome to use this repository as a starting ground for your landing page. I just want you to know that it was a very nice opportunity making this landing page for you.

## About the Developer

*   **Expertise:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, UX Design principles.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
